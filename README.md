# chatGPT
A single page serverless, lightweight, responsive, website to call GPT-3.5-Turbo Model using API.

## Note
- I would advise against hosting this webpage with the apiKey hardcoded as it may pose a risk of being leaked on the internet and OpenAI will disable the apiKey.
- Additionally, please refrain from using the apiKey provided in the about section, as it is intended only for new users to test quickly.

## How to get OpenAI API key
- Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and sign up for an account. 
- You can create an API key by clicking on the `Create new secret key` button.


### How to Use

```
1. Clone the Repo.
```

```
2. Open index.html file in browser
```

```
3. - Provide your apiKey in the textbox.
   - You can also appened it in the URL like, ' index.html?key=sk-xxx '
   - you can also hardcode apiKey if you dont have plan for hosting.
```
